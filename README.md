# Real-Time System Resource Monitoring

This Python script offers real-time monitoring of system resourcesâ€”CPU, memory, and disk usage. It provides immediate alerts when these resources exceed predefined thresholds, helping users proactively manage their system's performance.

## Features
- **Continuous Monitoring:** The script continuously checks CPU, memory, and disk usage at regular intervals.
- **Threshold Alerts:** When resource usage surpasses predefined thresholds (set at 80% in this example), the script generates immediate alerts in the console.
- **Customizable Thresholds:** Users can easily adjust the thresholds to their desired levels for resource usage warnings.
